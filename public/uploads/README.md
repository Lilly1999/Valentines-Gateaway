Place your PNG image here with the exact filename below (or update the path in src/pages/Index.tsx):

3034c621-7015-4fb6-b12c-ab75ef9d8f39.png

After you add the file, refresh the site — Vite serves files from `public/` at the site root (e.g. `/uploads/3034c621-7015-4fb6-b12c-ab75ef9d8f39.png`).

If you'd like to use the collage you uploaded in the chat, save it here as:

collage.jpg

After placing `collage.jpg` in this folder, the main hero image will display it at `/uploads/collage.jpg`.
